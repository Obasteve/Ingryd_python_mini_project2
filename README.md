In this example, the linear_search function takes a dictionary products containing product IDs as 
keys and product names as values. It iterates through the dictionary and checks if the provided
keyword is present in any of the product names. If found, it returns the corresponding product ID; 
otherwise, it returns None to indicate that the keyword doesn't match any product names.
